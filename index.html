                        My name is Rashawn Raiford. I amoriginally from Tignall, GA but have resided in Augusta, GA for over 10 years. 
                        Ever since I was a teenager, I have been fascinated with computers and taking on challenges. Computers were my way of
                        exploring places I have never been and seeing things I have never seen in person. After high school, I started college at 
                        Augusta State University. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Management Information Systems in 2012, but after taking a few 
                        programming classes during my junior and senior year I became fascinated with computer programming. After I graduated,
                        I started reading books and doing online courses to teach myself more about programming. After awhile, I became  
                        confident in my skills and began searching for a job as a software developer. After searching for months, I finally
                        was hired by a small company called TaxSlayer as a Junior Software Developer.                       
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have been employed at TaxSlayer for five years now. Complacency has never been my strong suit. I continue to learn new 
                        technologies to broaden my skill set. I have earned a Microsoft Certification in C# programming, and I plan on also
                        earning a Microsoft Certification in SQL, along with several others. As the technology industry continuously changes,
                        I would like to be apart of it as it does.
